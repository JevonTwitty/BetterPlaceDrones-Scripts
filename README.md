Scripts to generate flight plans in QGround Control

Created to be compatible with version 4.0 of QGroundControl

The type of files and layouts that can be inputted into the flight planning script is current limited; however, it will be updated some time in the future to account for this.

Look to ObstaclesExample.txt for an example txt file that can be inputted into the script, specifically the IntegratedFlightPlanner.py script, to output a flight path.
